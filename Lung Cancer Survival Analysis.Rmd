### Introduction

![](https://www.ilcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/142.jpg)

The picture above on the left is a stark visual contrast of a normal lung of a relatively health patient vs. a cancer lung of a lung cancer patient. Needless to say, there is quite a difference between the two. Lung cancer (LC) is a type of cancer that originates within the lungs that leaves a patient with symptoms of shortness of breath, the coughing of blood, and fluids within the chest cavity.^[https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lung-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20374620#:~:text=People%20with%20lung%20cancer%20can,Coughing%20up%20blood.] People with LC do not show these symptoms in the early LC stages but such symptoms are readily present when LC has metastasized to other organs and histologically advanced.^[https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lung-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20374620] 

The number one risk factor developing LC is cigarette smoking, and in the US smoking is linked to 80-90% of lung cancer deaths.^[https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/lung/basic_info/risk_factors.htm] Considering about 12.5% (30.8M) of US adults smoke cigarettes^[https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/resources/data/cigarette-smoking-in-united-states.html], it makes developing LC a likely outcome for these adults and thereby a public health concern since it affects over 10% of the US population.

Going deeper into the statistics, LC is the leading cause of most cancer deaths, taking almost up to 25%^[https://www.cancer.org/cancer/lung-cancer/about/key-statistics.html] and it is the leading cause of cancer in both men and females.^[https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/lung-cancer/resource-library/lung-cancer-fact-sheet] According to a 2019 US statistic, it is the leading cause of cancer behind female breast cancer and male prostate cancer.^[https://gis.cdc.gov/Cancer/USCS/#/AtAGlance/] Thereby again, making studying LC a top public health priority for both genders.

Because of the nature of diagnosing LC patients is most observable in the late stages of cancer development, conducting a Survival Analysis Rate would be beneficial for late stage patients as it provides a quantitative measure of time (i.e. days, weeks, or even months) for them and their family members. Survival Analysis furthur allows us an op[portunity to improve, create, and implement initiatives regarding palliative and hospice care.  

The objective of this project is that by studying the Survival Analysis Rate of advanced lung cancer patients, local and state governments are able to:

1. Educate the 12% population for an impending problem they will likely face. 
2. Discourage the underlying use of smoking and thereby decreasing the percentage of future LC patients.
3. Indirectly promote individual (i.e. stop buying high-priced cigarettes with disposable income) and community (i.e., decrease CO2 emission) utility (i.e., happiness).

Getting clinical data on LC patients can prove difficult. Therefore, a special acknowledgement to Loprinzo CL. et al.^[Loprinzi CL. Laurie JA. Wieand HS. Krook JE. Novotny PJ. Kugler JW. Bartel J. Law M. Bateman M. Klatt NE. et al. Prospective evaluation of prognostic variables from patient-completed questionnaires. North Central Cancer Treatment Group. Journal of Clinical Oncology. 12(3):601-7, 1994.] for their lung cancer research and also in providing this dataset in the survival package. Special acknowledgement to the 228 advanced lung cancer patients in the study.  

The raw dataset attributes are:

1. inst:	Institution code
2. time:	Survival time in days
3. status:	censoring status 1=censored, 2=dead
4. age:	Age in years
5. sex:	Male=1 Female=2
6. ph.ecog:	ECOG performance score as rated by the physician. 0=asymptomatic, 1= symptomatic but completely ambulatory, 2= in bed <50% of the day, 3= in bed > 50% of the day but not bedbound, 4 = bedbound
7. ph.karno:	Karnofsky performance score (bad=0-good=100) rated by physician
8. pat.karno:	Karnofsky performance score as rated by patient
9. meal.cal:	Calories consumed at meals
10. wt.loss:	Weight loss in last six months (pounds)



### Loading the Libraries
```{r, message=FALSE}
#install packages
#install.packages('survival') #installed on 12/3/22
#install.packages('ggpubr') installed on 12/3/22
#install.packages('skimr') #installed on 12/4/22

library(survival)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggpubr)
library(skimr)
library(ggpubr)
library(ggExtra)
library(RColorBrewer)
```
### Loading the Data
```{r}
#view the names of the dataset in Survival package
print(data(package = "survival"))
```
So, we will be using the survival package to get the dataset (the package has a bunch of datasets we can work with other types cancers as well as datasets involving survival analysis). 

So, let's choose the "cancer"  dataset that contains the LC patients and look at structure, then store it into a new object, data, for data cleaning.

```{r}
#see the structure of the dataset
str(cancer)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#provides more info about the dataset and the variables, which allows for
#better data cleaning
?cancer
```


```{r}
#store cancer dataset into a new object for data manipulation
data <- cancer
```

### Cleaning the Data
There are a couple tasks that needs to be done.

1. Because we looked at the structure, we see there are a few NA values; we need to delete the number of NA values. Because each observation is an individual, it is best to delete the observation to get the dataset tidy. Unlike business data (i.e. monthly profit), we cannot take the averages because we are dealing with individual patients.

2. We need to convert the variables into appropriate classes based on the data description in "?cancer". For example the variable status is a number and needs to converted to a factor. 

```{r}
#Count the number of NAs in the dataframe
sum((is.na(data)))
```
We have 67 NA values within our dataset. Let's use another method to locate the specific rows and columns where we might find these NA values.

```{r}
#find out specific observations in which there are NAs
which(is.na(data), arr.ind=TRUE)
```


Looking at the output we see a good amount in the double digits (10-90s) as well as the triple digits (100 and 200s). Interestingly , we see that many of the NA values are in the 9th and 10th rows, the meal.cal and wt.loss variables, respectively. Let's count the number of NAs in each column.

```{r}
#count the number of NAs within each column
colSums(is.na(data))
```
This is interesting. We see that majority of the NAs are in columns are in meal.cal and wt.loss. The most important variables for the survival analysis chart are time and status which have no NAs. 

Much data analysis is usually done with complete datasets, so in our case, I will delete observations that contain NAs and work with a tidy dataset. Nonetheless, it would interesting to see if the survival analysis chart would significantly change regardless if the dataset is tidy. So, I will plot 2 survival analysis charts: one with the complete dataset (data) and the other with the tidy dataset (data2).

So, let's further clean the data and check our work.
```{r}
#delete all the rows with NAs
data2 <- na.omit(data)

#count the number of NAs within each column
colSums(is.na(data2))
```
Ok, great! There are no NA values in our data2, our tidy dataset. Let's now work on changing the variable classes to its appropriate class and let's get rid of the first column since it doesnt provide any crucial details. 

```{r}
#creat list of variable names into a object
names <- c('status', 'sex', 'ph.ecog')
  
#convert some of the variabes to appropiate classes using 1 line of code
data2[names] <- lapply(data2[names], factor)

#check str again
sapply(data2, class)

#get rid of irrelevant coumns
data2 <- data2[,-1]

head(data2)
```
Great! We have correctly cleaned out data and now let's move on the the best part, EDA!



### Exploratory Data Analysis

Let's review some of the basic summary statistics via a new function, skimr. 
```{r}
#a function to call summary statistics
skim(data2)
```
With this function, we can see that the summary statistics of all the variables. The mean age is 63 years old, total meal calories is 929 and the weight loss is 9.8 pounds. 

Although the mean age is 63, let's split this into men and women.

This is interesting because both men and women have different calorie intake because the naturally difference in body composition. However, when diagnosed with cancer this could change So in the next steps, lets plot those distribution.

Another interesting thing is the weight loss. It would be interested to see how their calories differ as well as the weight loss. So let's plot those. 

#Lastly, the ph.karno and pat.karno are reported scores by the physican and patient. It would be interesting to see if #there is an relationship between the two.




```{r, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE}
#histogram of men and women ages
ggplot(data2, aes(x=age, group=sex, fill=sex)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, color= 'black') +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2") +
  facet_wrap(~sex, scales = 'free') +
  #scale_x_continuous(limits=c(30,90)) + #scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,20))
  theme_minimal()  #+
     #  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=10),
     #    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) #+
     # # labs(title = 'Men and Female Age Distributions',
     # #   x='Age (in years)',
     # #   y='Count')

```

Based on this, we see that there males have a symmetric distribution whereas the female is right-skewed with a few outliers to the left.  

```{r, message= FALSE}
ggplot(data2, aes(x = sex, y= meal.cal, fill = sex)) +
 geom_dotplot(binaxis='y', stackdir='center') +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = 'Number of Calories both Genders Consumed',
       x = 'Gender',
       y = 'Total Calories Per Day'
       ) +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=10),
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Because we are working with a small dataset, we can use a dotplot to see the number of calories both sexes had during the experiment. It seems they had roughly ~1000 calories for both groups. (Boxplot is in the appendix).

```{r}
data2 %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(mean(meal.cal))
```
We see that the males have a slight higher meal calories than the females. 

Let's see the realtionship between the patient and physician karno.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
g <-ggplot(data2, aes(ph.karno, pat.karno)) +
  geom_point(position= 'jitter') +
  geom_smooth(method='lm')

ggMarginal(g, type = 'boxplot',
           size = 3,
           fill=2)
```

Interesting. 

Let's plot the time by the count by the status.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message= FALSE}
ggplot(data2, aes(x=time, fill=status)) +
  geom_histogram(color='black', alpha =.5, position = 'identity') +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2") +
   theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = 'Time Duration of Participants',
       x = 'Time in Days',
       y = 'Count'
       ) +
   theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=10),
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
  
```

Interesting.

Now that we have explored the data. Let's go more into the theory of survival analysis.

### Survival Rate Analysis
Survival Analysis (SA) is the studying of the time between the entry of a study to its subsequent event. SA can be broken down into Survival and Time measures.

![](https://www.ncss.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Life-Table-Analysis-Survival-Plot.png){width=60%}

In terms of survival measures, it has traditionally been termed for studies regarding health outcomes, i.e., the time a person starts a drug treatment to their death, the time it takes for a durg addict to resrtart taking drugs after leaving a drug rehab center. However, it has also been used for business purposes, such as the amount of time it takes for a customer to buy a product once an email with a coupon is delivered to them or the time. Therefore, SA is used for a wide vareity of applications across a plethora of industries. In terms of time measures, it can be mesaured by days, weeks, years, etc. depending on the design of the experiment. 

Looking at the graph above, it can start at the top of the y-axis (survival measure) and decreases downward as the line moves across the x-axis (time).


Create survival objects
```{r}
#take a look each observations survial time
Surv(data2$time, data2$status)[1:10]
```
Let's take a look at the dataset.


Let's create a new object for survival analysis and double check we got all the observations from the previous code chunk. 
```{r}
# #create a km object
# km <-with(data2, Surv(time, status))
# 
# #check 
# head(km, 10)
```

Let's create the survival plot.
```{r}
#install.packages('ggsurvfit') #installed on 12/15/22
#install.packages('survminer') #installed on 12/15/22

library(ggsurvfit)
# library(survminer)

#tip: status column needs to be NUMERIC and NOT A FACTOR, otherwise, error when plotting
#convert data2$status back to a numeric for plotting
data2$status <-as.numeric(data2$status)

survfit2(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = data2) %>%
  ggsurvfit() +
  labs(
    title = 'Survival Analysis Probability of LC Patients',
    x = "Days",
    y = "Survival Probability of Cohort"
  ) +
  add_confidence_interval() +
  add_risktable()
```

Interesting

Let's plot the original dataset, data.
```{r}
survfit2(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = data) %>%
  ggsurvfit() +
  labs(
    title = 'Survival Analysis Probability of LC Patients',
    x = "Days",
    y = "Survival Probability of Cohort"
  ) +
  add_confidence_interval() +
  add_risktable()
```

Interesting. How do I compare the two?
