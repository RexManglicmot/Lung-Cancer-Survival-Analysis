### Status: Continuing Working Document
Hi everyone. Iâ€™m continuing building my data analysis and R skills. As such, I would love feedback to better improve this project via rexmanglicmot@gmail.com. Any mistakes and misrepresentation of the data are my own.

Things Need To DO:

1. More Theory of Survival Analysis
2. Create a dumbbell chart
2. Limitations
3. Check Grammar
4. More info on Lung Cancer and the NCCTG
5. General Statistics about lung cancer and WHY it is important to investigate
6. Create some cool looking plots


### Introduction

Lung Cancer is the leading cause of most cancer deaths, taking almost up to 25%.^[https://www.cancer.org/cancer/lung-cancer/about/key-statistics.html]Further, it is the leading cause of cancer in both men and females. ^[https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/lung-cancer/resource-library/lung-cancer-fact-sheet] According to a 2019 US statistic, it is the leading cause of cancer behind female breast cancer and male prostate cancer.^[https://gis.cdc.gov/Cancer/USCS/#/AtAGlance/] 

Survival Rate is a method in which we can measure the time of a an event from the start to finish. 

By studying the survival rate of lung cancer patients, local and state governments are able to educate the population for the impending problem they can likely face. By understanding surivival rates,

### Loading the Libraries
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#install packages
#install.packages('survival') #installed on 12/3/22
#install.packages('ggpubr') installed on 12/3/22
#install.packages('skimr') #installed on 12/4/22

library(survival)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggpubr)
library(skimr)
library(ggpubr)
```
### Loading the Data
```{r}
#view the names of the dataset in Survival package
print(data(package = "survival"))
```
So we see that the package has a bunch of datasets we can work with. So, let's choose the cancer dataset and view it. Let's store the dataset into a new object, data, for data cleaning.

```{r}
#see the structure of the dataset
str(cancer)
```


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#provides more info about the dataset and the variables, which allows for
#better data cleaning
?cancer

#store cancer dataset into a new object for data manipulation
data <- cancer
```

### Cleaning the Data
There are a couple tasks that needs to be done.

First, we need to delete the number of NA values. Because each observation is an individual, it is best to delete the obersvation to get the dataset tidy. It is also not best to find take the average of some sort  unlike business data (i.e. monthly profit).

Second, we need to convert the variables into appropoate classes based on the data description in ?cancer. For example the variable status is a number and needs to convereted to a factor. 

```{r}
#Count the number of NAs in the dataframe
sum((is.na(data)))
```
We have 67 NA values within out dataset. Let's use another method to locate the speicific row and location where we might find these values.

```{r}
#find out specific observations in which there are NAs
which(is.na(data), arr.ind=TRUE)
```
Looking at the output we see a good amount in the dougle digits as well as the triple digits (100 and 200s). Interestingly though, we see that many of the NA values are in the 9th and 10 rows, the meal.cal and wt.loss variables. Let's count the number of NAs in each variable.

```{r}
#count the number of NAs within each column
colSums(is.na(data))
```
This is interesting. We see that majority of the NAs are in columns are in meal.cal and wt.loss. The most important variables for the survival analysis are time and status which have no NAs. Much data analysis is usually done with complete datasets, so in our case, I will delete rows that contain NAs and work wit that data set. 

Nonetheless, it would interesting to see if the survival analysis would significantly change. So, I will plot 2: one with the complete data set and the other with the tidy data set, data2.

```{r}
#delete all the rows with NAs
data2 <- na.omit(data)

#count the number of NAs within each column
colSums(is.na(data2))
```


```{r}
#creat list of variable names into a object
names <- c('status', 'sex', 'ph.ecog')
  
#convert some of the variabes to appropiate classes using 1 line of code
data2[names] <- lapply(data2[names], factor)

#check str again
sapply(data2, class)

#get rid of irrelevant coumns
data2 <- data2[,-1]
```
Great! We have correctly cleaned out data and now let's move on the the best part, EDA!

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Let's review some of the basic summary statistics via a new function, skimr. 
```{r}
#a function to call summary statistics
skim(data2)
```
With this function, we can see that the summary statistics of all the variables. The mean age is 63 years old, total meal calories is 929 and the weight loss is 9.8 pounds. 

Although the mean age is 63, let's split this into men and women.

This is interesting because both men and women have different calorie intake because the naturally difference in body composition. However, when diagnosed with cancer this could change So in the next steps, lets plot those distribution.

Another interesting thing is the weight loss. It would be interested to see how their calories differ as well as the weight loss. So let's plot those. 

#Lastly, the ph.karno and pat.karno are reported scores by the physican and patient. It would be interesting to see if #there is an relationship between the two.




```{r}
#histogram of men and women ages
ggplot(data2, aes(x=age, group=sex, fill=sex)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, color= 'black') +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2") +
  facet_wrap(~sex) +
  theme_minimal()

```

Based on this, we see that there males have a symmetric distribution whereas the female is right-skewed with a few outliers to the left.  

```{r}
ggplot(data2, aes(sex, meal.cal)) +
  geom_hex(bins = 20, color = "white")+
  #NEED TO CHANGE COLORS
  scale_fill_gradient(low =  "#00AFBB", high = "#FC4E07")+
  theme_minimal()

ggplot(data2, aes(x = sex, y= meal.cal, fill = sex)) +
 geom_dotplot(binaxis='y', stackdir='center') +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2") +
  theme_minimal()
```
Because we are working with a small dataset, we can use a dotplot to see the number of calories both sexes had during the experiment. It seems they had roughly ~1000 calrories for both groups. (Boxplot is in the appendix).

```{r}
data2 %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(mean(meal.cal))
```
We see that the males have a slight higher meal calories than the females. 


```{r}
ggplot(data2, aes(x=time, y=wt.loss, fill=sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~sex) +
  theme_minimal()
```
```{r}
ggplot(data2, aes(x=age, y=wt.loss)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(linetype="dashed",
             color="orange", fill="lightpink") +
  theme_bw()
```


Now that we have explored the data. Let's go more into the theory of survial analysis.

### Survival Rate Analysis

![](https://www.ncss.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Life-Table-Analysis-Survival-Plot.png){width=75%}


Survival Analysis (SA) is the studying of the time between the entry of a study to its subsequent event. SA can be broken down into Survival and Time measures.

In terms of survival measures, it has traditionally been termed for studies regarding health outcomes, i.e., the time a person starts a drug treatment to their death, the time it takes for a durg addict to resrtart taking drugs after leaving a drug rehab center. However, it has also been used for business purposes, such as the amount of time it takes for a customer to buy a product once an email with a coupon is delivered to them or the time. Therefore, SA is used for a wide vareity of applications across a plethora of industries. In terms of time measures, it can be mesaured by days, weeks, years, etc. depending on the design of the experiment. 

Looking at the graph above, it can start at the top of the y-axis (survival measure) and decreases downward as the line moves across the x-axis (time).

Censoring is an important concept in SA and occurs
